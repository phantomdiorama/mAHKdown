## mAHKdown

A quick markdown previewer using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)

### Requirements
* [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/latest)
* [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/download/)

### Usage
Drag and drop markdown files onto **mAHKdown.ahk** and a preview will open in default browser. Delete out.html from desktop afterwards if you want.

### Similar Tools
The same could be achieved with a batch file and pandoc, or MultiMarkdown, or HastyScribe etc. This was just a excerise in learning AutoHotKey scripting.

### Tested On
Windows 7 32bit and AutoHotKey 1.1.22.07

#### Switch to pandoc
Development switched to pandoc for no other reason than it is what I now use. However [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) remains an excellent tool.
